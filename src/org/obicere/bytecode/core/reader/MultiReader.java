/**
 * Responsible for handling multiple readers depending on some identifier.
 * This allows cases where the format defines an abstract format with many
 * concrete formats that could be ran. This is therefore most
 * representative of a union. The purpose of this, as opposed to a single,
 * much larger reader, is that this allows flexibility. A reader often
 * corresponds to a single format revolving around primitive types. Often,
 * these primitive types are unsigned <code>byte</code>,
 * <code>halfword</code>, <code>word</code> and <code>doubleword</code>
 * values. These values will be read into a data type, corresponding to
 * the type <code>T</code>. In the case the format is failed to be read,
 * instead of returning <code>null</code>, an {@link java.io.IOException}
 * should be thrown describing the error.
 * <h1>An example format:</h1>
 * For example, one may represent a call to a mathematical library as:
 * <pre>{@code call {
 *     u1   function
 *     u2   num_parameters
 *     {
 *          u2  name
 *          u4  value
 *     } parameter[num_parameters]
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * Here, two readers would be recommended. One to read the
 * <code>call</code> format and one to read the <code>parameter</code>
 * format. The types <code>u1</code>, <code>u2</code>, and <code>u4</code>
 * represent an unsigned <code>byte</code>, <code>halfword</code> and
 * <code>word</code>, respectively.
 * <h1>Limitations of the JVM:</h1>
 * The processing of these data types would correlate to the functions
 * available in the
 * {@link org.obicere.bytecode.core.util.IndexedDataInputStream} stream. Due to
 * some restrictions on the JVM, <code>u4</code> and <code>u8</code>
 * values may not be represented appropriately. This is because the
 * unsigned <code>doubleword</code> is too large to store while losing any
 * precision and the <code>word</code> - when relating to the index of an
 * array - is beyond the bounds of the JVM.
 * <p>
 * <h1>Relation to a class file format:</h1>
 * The format of the mathematical call format uses the same format
 * specified by the jvms-4.1. Therefore a single one-to-one correlation
 * can be formed between the specification, the available readers and the
 * corresponding data types.
 * <p>
 * For example, the format for a
 * {@link org.obicere.bytecode.core.objects.code.instruction.AbstractInstruction} follows
 * the loose form of:
 * <pre>{@code Instruction {
 *     u1   opcode
 *     u1   operand1
 *     u1   operand2
 *     ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * However, this changes from instruction-to-instruction. For example, the
 * {@link org.obicere.bytecode.core.objects.code.instruction.DefaultNop} format is just:
 * <pre>{@code nop {
 *     u1   opcode
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * Contrasted to the
 * {@link org.obicere.bytecode.core.objects.code.instruction.aload} format:
 * <pre>{@code aload {
 *     u1   opcode
 *     u1   indexbyte1
 *     u1   indexbyte2
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * To provide a single reader for both of these cases would be overly
 * complex and prone to error. Therefore three readers would be defined.
 * Two of which read the independent formats and the third, a multi-reader
 * , which redirects the format to the appropriate independent reader.
 * <p>
 * This is accomplished by linking each independent reader to a
 * corresponding key <code>K</code>. The given format should therefore
 * define a key for this to be used. Otherwise, there is no way a
 * multi-reader could be used, as differentiating between formats would be
 * obscure and too costly.
 * <p>
 * This is then mirrored in the corresponding reader:
 * {@link org.obicere.bytecode.core.reader.code.instruction.InstructionReader} which
 * is the responsible reader for the independent readers.
 * <p>
 * Due to the availability of this specification, each reader should
 * explicitly specify the format for which it is reading. And each type
 * should describe for usage of the format in context of the type itself.
 * Any discrepancies between the reader and the format should be noted
 * and explain thoroughly.
